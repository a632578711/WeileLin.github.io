  In my opinion, IntelliJ IDEA is a relatively new Java IDE. It is the most useful one in the 
Java development environment. The highly optimized Intellij Idea makes common tasks quite easy, Idea supports many integration features, and more importantly makes them easy to design. IntelliJ IDEA can speed up programmer programming as much as possible. It includes a lot of auxiliary features and is quite well integrated with Java. Different tool windows surround the main programming window, which can be opened when the mouse is clicked, and can be easily closed when not in use, allowing the user to maximize the effective screen range. 	

  I used Eclipse and Java all the time, but I found that some of the tutorials used the Intellij IDE, and I found that Eclipse does have some shortcomings in Web programming, especially on the page, and the latest version of Intellij and The interface and style of the old version are very different. There is a working space in Eclipse. This is no stranger to many programmers. IntelliJ IDEA has no working space. In Eclipse, you can only open one project and then write the project. IntelliJ IDEA creates the project frist, then Create the module after, the project is the top level, and the module is the secondary level; simply put, Eclipse can only open one workspace at the same time, intelliJ IDEA can open multiple "workspaces" at the same time. 

   After first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, my impressions about this IDE is       not easy to get used to it. I believe that getting the green checkmark is useful even thought I did not really rely on it to find the error. In conclusion, this software is very popular with its smart real-time analysis and convenient refactoring function. The disadvantage is that it is more complicated and difficult for beginners to understand.
