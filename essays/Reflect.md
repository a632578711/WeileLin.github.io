	In my opinion, a programmer don't need too many writing skills, but must some skills about ask questions in smart way. “In the world of hackers the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer.” —Reference by Eric Steven Raymond. That is my favorite sentence in his essay. When I was young, my dream was to be a hacker because I thought it was so cool. Later, I wanted to be a game producer because I wanted to show my ideas to others in my game. Since I started to get into computer programming, I think this is not a simple matter. I need to strengthen my programming skills to achieve my goals. However, the skill of ask question in smart way is necessary for improve my programming skill, and this is the topic today. 
	I believe that use online resource to find the answer to the question is something that a programmer often do. The difference between programmers and other liberal arts students is the use of online resources. General liberal arts students cannot directly quote online articles because this is plagiarism. Students who learn programming can directly quote online theories to help themselves, but just follow the police of copy.
