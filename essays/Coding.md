  In my opinion, IntelliJ IDEA is a relatively new Java IDE. It is the most useful one in the 
Java development environment. The highly optimized Intellij Idea makes common tasks quite easy, Idea supports many integration features, and more importantly makes them easy to design. IntelliJ IDEA can speed up programmer programming as much as possible. It includes a lot of auxiliary features and is quite well integrated with Java. Different tool windows surround the main programming window, which can be opened when the mouse is clicked, and can be easily closed when not in use, allowing the user to maximize the effective screen range.
