	    In a corner of the world there is a small city call “ ZhongShan”, many famous person was born there such as Sun ZhongShan. During World War II, there used to be a battlefield. It’s a small city, and it becomes famous because of some wonderful people. That is my hometown, a place of all my childhood memory. 
	  
      
      My name is WeiLe lin, nick name is Lok. I am transfer student from Kapiolani Community College and this is my first semester of university Manoa. My favorite subject is information computer science, therefore I choose this subject to became my major. My goal is to study this major in future and become a respected professional in one of the fields. 
	  
      
      I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy the process of making new friends, no matter which environment or location. Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. In my opinion, I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.
	  
  
  
  
  
     In addition to spending time with friends. I also enjoy spent my free time to read a novel  in library or cafe by myself.  By the time I put my headphone on and play some piano music when I reading my novel, I would feel like that must be the most relax thing in the world. Sometime I exhort myself  I shouldn’t have that kind of retirement thought in my age, but I hope that my life is peaceful every day.
	  
    
    
    I have another very violent hobby, that is ride a motorcycle. I believe that every man’s dream garage wants to have a motorcycle of their own. Motorcycles are divided into many different types, such as sport bike, cruiser, touring and etc. The different between ride motorcycle and drive car is one is constrained and the other is free. Specially ride in Hawaii, I can feel the wind pass by me and the sun shining on me. Motorcycles are a kind of romance for men, it’s also a kind of passion of my life. 
	
     
     
     
     For this world, everyone is a small existence. In my opinion, a person's contribution to society can transcend his existence. There are still many people in the world who need help, and they all have very difficult days. We should be happy that we live in a comfortable environment. In my future plans, I hope that I can use the knowledge I have learned to help people or animals in need. There are some people  think that they can only live once, so they indulge their behavior, but they forgot that there is only one earth.
