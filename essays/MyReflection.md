As the first semester student in University of  Hawaii Manoa, ICS 314 is my first 300 level class in my school life. In fact, I had doubts about this class before I started school, because I think 300+ class must be harder than my previous class. However, this class did not disappoint me. It is indeed harder than other classes.  I have had the idea of drop this class because I feel that I am cannot handle for this class. I still think I can give it a try. ICS 314 is about learning about web design and is one of the subject I am interested in. The software that will be used in this lesson is Javascript. I will be discuss about my personal opinion about this software. 
	As a newbie of Javascript, I feel that this is totally different from java. For me, java is a novice programming software that is easy to get started with. Javascript is a more advanced programming software, but it has more space than java. From a language perspective, Java needs to set more languages than Javascript, while Javascript uses the least and most concise language to express what I want. And more interestingly, I found that Javascript makes me feel that I am learning about web design. In general, I think Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. 
	In conclusion, I still believe that software engineering is a interesting subject in computer science. The style in this class makes me feel a bit like the Chinese way of education, which gives me a sense of oppression, but this will make me learn more. I will try to enjoy this process, and I believe this is a great help for me.
