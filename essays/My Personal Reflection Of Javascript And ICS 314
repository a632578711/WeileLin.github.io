    As the first semester student in University of  Hawaii Manoa, ICS 314 is my first 300 level class in my school life. In fact, I had doubts about this class before I started school, because I think 300+ class must be harder than my previous class. However, this class did not disappoint me. It is indeed harder than other classes.  I have had the idea of drop this class because I feel that I am cannot handle for this class. I still think I can give it a try. ICS 314 is about learning about web design and is one of the subject I am interested in. The software that will be used in this lesson is Javascript. I will be discuss about my personal opinion about this software.
