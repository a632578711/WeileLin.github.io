summary: As a Chinese 290 Student, I need to be a totur for Chinses 101 or 102 class. This is a service learning project to help us to learning about how to be a teacher.

   Different experiences always make people learn more things. In my Chinese class, students need to do the service learning to makes some experiences to improve personal knowledge. In here, I want to discuss about my experiences in my service learning and how do I learn from those experiences.
   
   Doing this service learning can help me on my future career. My future career is to be a programmer. I learned how to explain complicated things to people by using simple and easier examples to help them understand it better. I also learned not to rushed because it will make the situation worse.
